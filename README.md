# Global Energy Pulse: A Transition & Economic Audit (2010–2025)
## 📌 Project Overview
The **Global Energy Pulse** is a comprehensive Power BI suite designed to analyze the global shift from fossil fuel dependency to low-carbon alternatives. This project explores the "Great Swap"—tracking how sovereign nations are decoupling economic growth from carbon-intensive energy consumption.

### 📊 Key Dashboards
**1.The Fossil Fuel Audit:** A deep dive into global coal, gas, and oil reliance.

**2.The Green Transition:** Tracking progress toward Net Zero and measuring the "Transition Gap."

**3.Economic Impact:** A motion-enabled analysis of GDP vs. Energy Intensity (Efficiency).

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights
### Data Cleaning & Governance: Curated a global dataset to remove regional aggregates (e.g., "North America") to ensure sovereign nation-state comparisons and prevent data double-counting.

### Advanced DAX Modeling:

**Estimated GDP:** Reverse-engineered from energy intensity metrics to provide economic scale.

**Transition Gap:** A dynamic measure calculating the distance between current low-carbon shares and the 50% sustainability benchmark.

**Green Efficiency Score:** A custom KPI rewarding high renewable adoption paired with low energy waste.

**Visual Storytelling:** Implemented motion-based scatter plots (Play Axis) to visualize historical economic shifts and utilized conditional formatting for real-time KPI status.

## 💡 Key Insights
**Decoupling Wealth from Pollution:** The data reveals that leading economies (e.g., Sweden, Norway) are successfully growing GDP while simultaneously lowering their energy intensity.

**The Transition Gap:** While low-carbon energy is rising, the "Gap" remains significant in emerging markets, highlighting a critical area for future global investment.

**Efficiency as a Driver:** High-income nations aren't just using different energy; they are using less energy per unit of GDP compared to 2010.
